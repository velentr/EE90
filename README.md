# Smart Dog Bowl

For this EE 90 project, we are required to build a 'smart' dog bowl that will
open only when a specific dog is nearby. This would be used, for example, when
feeding different types of food to different dogs.

My design is based on performing frequency analysis on the dog's bark to
determine which dog is trying to open the bowl. Additionally, the bowl is
equipped with ultrasonic range finders to check for a nearby object before
opening. This will prevent the bowl from opening when, for example, the dog
starts barking at the mailman.

More details for the design can be found in the proposal. Datasheets for the
parts I am using are in the `doc` directory. All schematics for the
circuits in my design are in the `sch` directory.

Feel free to use any part of this design that you find useful. Obviously, the
Honor Code prevents other students from using this on their own EE 90 projects.
